/**
  This API provides a way to unblock certain data pages to be accessible inside MM environment.

  The requested buffer needs to be page size aligned and mapped as data pages. The unblocked
  buffer will labeled as CPL3 data pages accessible by user mode drivers. MM supervisor will
  reject the unblock request after Ready-To-Lock event is signaled or whenever supervisor deems
  a necessity to lock down memory management.

  @param  UnblockAddress          The address of buffer caller requests to unblock, the address
                                  has to be page aligned.
  @param  NumberOfPages           The number of pages requested to be unblocked from MM
                                  environment.
  @param  IdentifierGuid          The unique caller ID from requester.

  @return EFI_SUCCESS             The request goes through successfully.
  @return EFI_SECURITY_VIOLATION  The requested address failed to pass security check for
                                  unblocking.
  @return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   Input address or caller ID is either NULL pointer or not aligned.
  @return EFI_ACCESS_DENIED       The request is rejected by MM supervisor due to memory map is
                                  locked down.
